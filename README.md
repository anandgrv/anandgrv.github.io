### Predicting Political Orientation From Twitter Data (Italian political parties)

#### The objective of this project was to predict political orientation from twitter contents. Twitter is a social networking service that allows users to post real time messages (called tweets). In the first phase we collected data based on an online survey that indirectly asked about the political preference of the surveyed individuals and data based on looking up twitter accounts that follow one of 5 parties included in the analysis (Lega, Movimento-5-Stelle, Partito Democratico, Forza Italia and Fratelli d’Italia) from the parties’ official twitter accounts. The second phase consisted of downloading tweets from the accounts gathered in phase 1. In the Third phase, the data was preprocessed and prepared. This was achieved by cleaning the data from noise and applying some of the feature engineering techniques. In the final phase, we tried multiple classifiers such as the Logistic Regression Model, Xgboost Classifier, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier and Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier. From these models, we could finally predict the political orientation of “Movimento-5-Stelle” followers.

### Image Classification with Fashion - MNIST data (Zalando.de)

#### Image classification is a supervised learning problem, models are trained on labelled sample images to classify new unseen images. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Analyzing the dataset, we concluded that most of the classic ML models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forests, and k-Nearest Neighbors) as well as simple Neural Network achieve an accuracy of 85%-90% and in all of them the main struggle was differentiating between two out of the ten classes, namely the shirt and t-shirt classes. In order to better evaluate the model we tried Convolutional Neural Network using multiple filters which are trained to detect different features.

### Statistical analysis on the data gathered during Covid-19 outbreak (Worldwide)

#### The objective of this project was to perform a Statistical Data Analysis of the worldwide COVID -19 outbreak. The data was collected from five major sources like World Health Organization (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), WorldoMeters, COVID Tracking Project and Oxford University. The data was preprocessed and prepared. This was achieved by cleaning the data from noise and applying some of the feature engineering techniques. In the end, we applied Linear Regression model and polynomial models to analyze the peak of the total number of confirmed cases globally and see the trend of confirmed cases vs recovery vs death across the globe. From these models, we could predict the global trend of confirmed cases peak.
